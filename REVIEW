\begin{abstract}
The $\rm PM_{2.5}$  pollution incidents occurred frequently in the past years around the world due to rapid development of industry and massive consumption of energy, which has detrimental effects on atmospheric environment and human health. In this context, a great number of researches have been proposed to predict the concentration of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ recently. These methods can generally be categorized into knowledge-driven methods and data-driven methods. Nevertheless, the data-driven ones have received more attention because of relatively less requirement for application restrictions and background knowledge in atmospheric science, what is more, the development of data collection and storage techniques also boots the demand for data-driven ones. This work begins with the introduction of common methods for $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction. Moreover, we specifically focused on the data-driven methods, with an emphasis on $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction and summarize their main contributions as well as the limitations. Finally, the conclusion of current research, along with the suggestions for future works are provided. The original intention of this paper is to show the overall research status of current developments and act as the reference or tutorial for researchers.

\section{ Introduction}

$\rm PM_{2.5}$ (Fine particulate matter with a diameters smaller than 2.5 ¦Ìm) is one of the most common air pollutants according to the World Health Organization (WHO) \cite{kim2015review}, which is mainly come from extensive industrial and anthropogenic emissions. Because of its small size, the physiological structure of the human body determines that particles with such small size cannot be filtered and blocked. When these particles are absorbed into human lungs, especially the children and old, leading severe respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases due to its deleteriousness \cite{hoek2013long,brook2010particulate}. What is more, $\rm PM_{2.5}$ can stay in the air for a long time and travel for a long distance because of the smaller size. Hence, it even has greater impacts on the quality of the atmospheric environment and human health compared with the coarser particles, and the authors of \cite{lim2012comparative} pointed that $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentrations ranked ninth in all the threats. Since then, the fact that $\rm PM_{2.5}$ is the most dangerous pollutants has been gradually recognized and accepted people, particularly in China, England, India, and the United States \cite{tang2016integration}, which promotes the research on $\rm PM_{2.5}$  in various related fields around the world.
As one of the most important aspects of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ studies, the prediction of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration \cite{cohen2017estimates, kinney2008climate, lelieveld2015contribution, pannullo2017quantifying} has abidingly caught great attention from scientists in many fields since it can provided the short-term prevention plans and efficiently reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by $\rm PM_{2.5}$, thus protecting the health and vital interests of people. However, effective prediction of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration is always a challenging work due to the complex generation mechanism, seasonality, regionalism, and so on. To some degree, $\rm PM_{2.5}$ pollution is the inevitable outcome due to the sustainable development of global economy. Nevertheless, this does not mean that there is no ways to control and relieve the pollution bring by the $\rm PM_{2.5}$. Furthermore, some initial tentative works can be found in \cite{baklanov2006overview, melse2012removal, dong2009pm2}.

To date, numerous scientific research results on $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction have been presented in the past ten years. These studies can be generally split into three major classes: empirical-based methods, physical-based methods and data-based methods \cite{guo2018improving} (see Fig. \ref{0920}). Generally speaking, empirical-based models are built on rich engineering experience and it is easy to implement when the process knowledge or expert experience has been gained or cumulated. Nevertheless, the process knowledge are not always available in practice, especially for the complex atmospheric environment, thus the prediction accuracy will be largely affected and the scope of application is greatly limited. Besides, physical-based methods tend to simulate the evolution mechanism of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ according to the strong background or professional knowledge in atmospheric discipline. As a result, this kind of method usually outperform other models when enough physical mechanisms are obtained. Additionally, model-based methods are often built case by case. Therefore, it is inconvenient to extent a certain model-based method to other situation. Apart from the abovementioned two types of prediction methods, the data-driven methods predict the $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration within a certain period of time, mainly through analyzing the previously process data, which do not involve the chemical and physical processes. What is more, with the rapid development of modern digital technology, the advanced atmosphere data acquisition and storage techniques also provide convenience for data-driven $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction and have attracted wide application and promotion in the past decades \cite{biancofiore2017recursive, xie2018autoencoder, reid2015spatiotemporal, mahajan2018improving, garcia2016developing}. Under this background, this paper concentrates on data-driven methods mainly include but are not limited to statistical methods, machine learning algorithm, and artificial intelligence models.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Subject of This Paper}
The subject of this paper is to systematically review the relevant works on data-based methods applied to $\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration prediction, followed by the detailed analysis of each of them and serve as the reference or tutorial for atmospheric researchers.

\subsection{ Search Strategy}
In order to select the relative papers to be studied in this paper, several steps were took to guarantee the appropriate representativeness and rigor, which are show as below.
Firstly, the relevant papers were surveyed in Web of Science (WOS) and Science Direct electronic databases since they host all JCR-indexed journals in the research area of atmospheric environment. Then search the papers with the combination of keywords as follows: (¡°$\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration prediction¡±) OR (¡°$\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration predict¡±) AND (¡°$\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration forecast¡±) OR (¡°$\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration forecasting¡±), these keywords were searched in article¡¯s title, abstract and keywords, and just the papers in English were considered. Another principle was to select the journal papers only, since they embody the most successful achievements. Logical combinations of ¡°AND¡± and ¡°OR¡± are used to allow combination of keywords when searching in database and there are no restrictions on the publication time of documents. After this step, we obtain 231 eligible papers.

\subsection{Inclusion and Filtering Criteria}
The second step is inclusion and filtering the papers. After reading the abstract and full texts of the 231 papers. The inclusion criteria are: (1) the repeated articles in the two databases; (2) the paper that predict the $\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration based on empirical-based methods, physical-based methods; (3) the contents of paper that does not conform to the requirements, which focus on estimation the impact on human health but not the predict the concentration of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ , the smog disaster cause by high concentration $\rm PM_{2.5}$ , indoor $\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration researches and so on; (4) the papers with the similar or repetitive results that presented by the same authors. After implementing these filtering criteria, the eligible papers are reduced to 105. Then these papers are entirely read, thus the main features of these works could be presented and discussed in this paper.

\subsection{Flow Chart of Search Method}
After the several steps above, the 105 most relevant data-based papers for PM2.5 concentration prediction are finally determined. The flowchart of selection criteria of the relevant papers is described in Fig. \ref{0936}.

\section{ Overview of Data-driven approaches for $\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration prediction}
In this section, the state-of-the art of data-driven approaches for PM2.5 concentration prediction are surveyed through several different viewpoints.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing Issues}
Since the methods investigated in this paper are belonging to the category of data-driven. Hence, it is necessary to preprocess the data to be modeled for enhanced concentration prediction performance. Especially, in the era of data and information explosion. And the mainstream preprocessing techniques are concisely described as below:

\subsubsection{Normalization}
The normalization skill can unify data from different dimensions to eliminate  the effects of data dimensional, thus all the data item are taking values in the same interval and the convergence speed of model is also improved. Note that if data are normalized before inputed the output data must be inverse-normalized to keep the dimensional consistency  and the frequently-used normalization function in  MATLAB is the $mapminmax(\cdot)$.

\subsubsection{Handling missed values}
Measurements of some atmosphere data are missing sometimes due to the complexity of the object and the limitation of the acquisition method. Hence, complete the missing values is necessary in practice. Junger et al. \cite{junger2015imputation} proposed an expectation-maximization based algorithm to handle the missing value, which consider both the correlations and temporal components of the data. Interpolation is an important method to estimate missing data by using known sample data and the successful application of these methods can refer to \cite{hueglin2005chemical,van2015high,cordero2013assessing,garcia2016association}, the details are omitted here since it is not the  core content of this paper.
\subsubsection{Input selection techniques}
Since not every collected variable is related to the prediction models. The existence of a large number of measurement variables will inevitably lead to increased computational complexity and degraded model performance \cite{li2018feature}. As a preprocessing skill, the feature extraction method can help extract variables containing more useful information to improve the efficiency of $\rm PM_{2.5}$  concentration prediction. Therefore, it is gradually becoming an indispensable step in the implementation process of prediction. And some popular feature selection techniques, such as stepwise regression \cite{neter1996applied}, LASSO \cite{tibshirani1996regression}, SCAD \cite{fan2001variable} and MCP \cite{zhang2010nearly} are studied.

\subsection{Neural Network-Based Methods}
Artificial neural network is powerful modeling tool due to its strong nonlinear processing and parallel computing capability. And has gained great success in signal processing, predicting the pollutant concentrations, pattern recognition and many other fields. This part mainly introduces the mainstream neural network and their applications in $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction.

\subsubsection{BP Neural Network}
BP neural network is firstly introduced by Rumelhart and McCelland and received great attention in application areas in the past decades. BP neural network typically has three layers, that are input layer, hidden layer and output layer, which are often used for signals forward transmission and errors back propagation purposes. When the input values, the number of node, training methods, transfer function and so on are provided, then the BP neural networks can work normally. However, if we cannot get the expected error in the output layer, then the neural network will propagates back to modify the connection weight and threshold in the network according to the errors and train the network constantly until the prediction error approach the expected ones, after that, the mapping relationship between the input layer and output layer is finally confirmed.

Chen et al. \cite{chen2014comparative} utilized the air pollution $\rm PM_{2.5}$ index and surface meteorological observation data of Wuhan City over the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 to predict the $\rm PM_{2.5}$ index based on BP neural network and the empirical study demonstrated that the BP neural network obtained high prediction accuracy and better prediction affect than regression prediction model. The authors of \cite{wang2013bp} used the BP artificial neural network to predict the spatial variability of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ daily concentrations and the simulation results showed that the BP artificial neural network can provided promising performance regarding mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) than the Ordinary Kriging (OK) method. More recently, Wang et al. \cite{wang2018research} presented an improved BP neural network, which was optimized by genetic algorithm (GA) and data result verified that the new neural network acquired satisfactory performance in $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction.

\subsubsection{Fuzzy Neural Network}
Fuzzy Neural Network is generally the fusion of neural network and fuzzy logic systems (FLSs) \cite{han2018interval}, which inherits the excellences of both ANNs and FLS and also overcomes the shortcomings of them, thus show great potential in practical applications.

Zhou et al. \cite{zhou2017prediction} proposed a feedback neural network-recurrent fuzzy neural network (RFNN) to deal with the complex nonlinear dynamic in $\rm PM_{2.5}$, the simulation results verify that the proposed RFNN has a lower RMSE values than FNN and RBF network since it considers the dynamic information among different variables. The authors of \cite{ma2014prediction} combined the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with fuzzy neural network to make the prediction more efficient and the experimental result proved that the new method is more practical in predicting the $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration. Recently, Qiao et al. \cite{qiao2017predicting} used a second order self-organizing fuzzy neural network (SOFNN) to predict the concentrations of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ for the next 24 h. Then the parameters of SOFNN are adjusted by a second order gradient (SOG) algorithm. Ultimately, the developed SOG-SASOFNN model showed satisfying performance for prediction the hourly concentrations of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ during both training stage and test stage.

\subsubsection{ Deep Neural Network}
The traditional neural networks usually show some limitations in dealing with the complex object or large-scale data \cite{hinton2006fast}, which motivated the development of deep neural networks (DNN). Generally speaking, DNN is consisted of many vertical layers, and has been proved that it is able to established an advanced feature space and commendably represent the diverse functions \cite{bengio2007greedy}. The successes achieved by DNN is mainly due to its powerful computing ability, specifically, it can fully use the large amount of the training data to train the layer by layer greedily in an unsupervised way and then the weights in the network can be confirmed.

The authors of \cite{ong2016dynamically} developed a deep recurrent neural network (DRNN) model, which is enhanced by a new pre-training method using auto-encoder specifically tailored for $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentrations prediction and the simulation results show that DRNN proposed in this paper is superior than auto-encoder training method. Fan et al. \cite{fan2017spatiotemporal} designed a novel DRNN framework that consists of LSTM (Long Short-term Memory) layer and fully connected layer, then the experiments in real-world meteorological datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed method. More recently, Benitez et al. \cite{loy2019sequential} utilized the (DRNN) to carry out a point-by-point prediction regarding the $\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration and, the proposed model demonstrated the best performance for a 6h time lag. Furthermore, for the time lags, such as 12h, 18h and 24h, the performance of the new model is also acceptable.

\subsubsection{ Long short-term memory neural network}
Although the general recurrent neural network (RNN) has showed great achievements in various fields, it cannot model the long-term dependence owing to gradient disappearance or explosion matters \cite{bengio1994learning}. An alternative solution to this problem is the LSTM network \cite{hochreiter1997long}, which establishes a novel structure called memory cell, it can store the long-term dependencies. And the storage unit usually has three main elements: input gate, forget gate and output gate.

Zhao et al. \cite{zhao2019long} developed a long short-term memory-fully connected (LSTM-FC) neural network, which mainly include two parts, that are, the local variation of $\rm PM_{2.5}$ contamination by the LSTM-based simulator to model and the spatial dependencies between the central station and the neighbor ones by neural network-based spatial combinatory. And the LSTM-FC model shows a better predictive performance over artificial neural network (ANN) and LSTM models regarding the same meteorological dataset. The authors of \cite{wen2019novel} presented a convolutional long short-term memory neural network extended (C-LSTME) method, it combines the advantages of both the convolutional neural network (CNN) and LSTM neural network. The simulation experiments show that the proposed method achieved higher prediction accuracy than currently used methods regarding different time at different regional scales. Recently, \cite{li2017long} compared six different models, including the LSTME model, and the LSTME algorithm showed the best prediction performance over others regarding the same dataset.

\subsubsection{ Discussions and comparisons}
In past years, several other kinds of neural networks based methods also have been developed for
$\rm PM_{2.5}$ concentration prediction, such as radial basis function (RBF) neural networks \cite{ordieres2005neural}, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) type of neural network \cite{mao2017prediction}, Self-organizing maps (SOMs) neural networks \cite{zhang2018critical} and so on. However, they do not account for much of the existing literatures, thus this paper has not introduced each of them separately due to page length.

Though the neural networks-based models have achieved great success successes in the past years due to its various advantages. Nevertheless, they also suffer from some "Common Defects". For example, most of the neural networks required large number of samples to trained the model for better performance, which maybe unavailable in practice. In addition, the number of network node and network layer is difficult to determine and mainly depend on  experience or multiple attempts. In addition, some networks may suffer from slow convergence. There are also some else shortages
that are not universal for all  neural networks-based approaches but confined to part of them, the details are showed in Table. \ref{1538}.
